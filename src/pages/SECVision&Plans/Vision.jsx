            My vision as Member of Parliament for South East Clarendon is to
            build a better SEC by increasing employment, improving
            infrastructure, expanding access to water, education and other
            resources, in a manner that will heighten the standard of living
            among all residents in the constituency.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mission is to build communities and empower constituents to
            provide for themselves and contribute to the countryâ€™s economic and
            social growth.

              issues, your concerns are my concerns.
